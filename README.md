# bootcamp [![Build Status][badge]][build]

Example project using [the boot build tool][boot] with the [boot-cljs],
[boot-cljs-repl], and [boot-reload] tasks. Derived from [boot-cljs-example].

## Prepare

[Install boot][installboot].  Then, in a terminal:

```bash
boot -u
```

This will update boot to the latest stable release version. Since boot is
pre-release software at the moment, you should do this frequently.

## Development

In a terminal do:

```bash
boot dev
```

You can view the generated content by opening
[http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html)
in your browser.

## Start Browser REPL

With the build pipeline humming in the background, you can connect to the running nREPL
server with either your IDE or at the command line in a new terminal:

```bash
boot repl --client
```

or in Emacs:

```
M-x cider-connect
```

Then, you can start a CLJS REPL:

```clojure
boot.user=> (start-repl)
```

Reload the page in your browser.  Your REPL is now connected to the page. (If it's not, try touching
one of the *.cljs files to trigger recompilation, refresh the page and try again.)
