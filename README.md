# bootcamp [![Build Status][badge]][build]

Bootcamp is a server and clientside application that harvests data about
existing [Boot][boot] projects from GitHub and displays it in the browser.

## Development

For development, I like to run the frontend and backend in different processes
so that one can be restarted if necessary without stopping the other.

```bash
# start the backend
boot serve-backend wait
```

And in another terminal:

```bash
boot run-frontend
```

If you would rather just run the application in one terminal only,
you can combine the two with the `dev` task:

```bash
boot dev
```

You can view the generated content by opening
[http://localhost:8484](http://localhost:8484)
in your browser.
